      question: "What is the difference between SBA Phase I and Phase II?",
      answer: "Phase I is for **feasibility and proof of concept** (up to $295,000, 6-12 months). Phase II is for **prototype development** (up to $1.9M, 24 months). You generally must win Phase I to apply for Phase II."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I have to give up equity for SBIR grants?",
      answer: "No. SBIR/STTR awards are **non-dilutive**. The government takes zero ownership of your company and you retain all intellectual property rights."
    },
    {
      question: "Can a single founder apply for SBIR?",
      answer: "Yes, but the Principal Investigator (PI) must be primarily employed by the small business (over 50% time) at the time of award. You don't need a large team to start."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the success rate for SBIR Phase I?",
      answer: "It varies by agency, but generally ranges from **10% to 15%**. NSF and NIH are competitive. Phase II success rates are much higher, often around 40-50%."

      question: "What is the deadline for the NY CFA?",
      answer: "The **Consolidated Funding Application (CFA)** usually opens in May and closes in **late July**. It is a hard deadline. Missing it means waiting a full year for regional council funds."
    },
    {
      question: "Are New York business grants taxable?",
      answer: "Yes. Most state grants are considered **taxable income** by the IRS and New York State. Tax credits (like Excelsior) reduce your tax bill directly."
    },
    {
      question: "Does the Excelsior Jobs Program apply to remote workers?",
      answer: "Generally, no. The program is designed to create jobs **within New York State**. Employees typically need to be based at a physical location in NY to count toward your job creation targets."

    {
      question: "Can startups get the Global NY Export Grant?",
      answer: "Yes, if you are export-ready. You must be operating for at least one year and have a product ready for international markets. It reimburses up to 50% of export costs."

    {
      question: "What counts as 'rural' for USDA grants?",
      answer: "It depends on the specific program. For **REAP**, it's usually populations under 50,000. For **Rural Business Development Grants**, it can be under 50,000. Always check the specific USDA eligibility map for your address."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I get a grant to buy a farm?",
      answer: "Generally, no. USDA offers **low-interest loans** for farm ownership, not grants. Grants are typically for value-added processing, energy efficiency, or business development, not land acquisition."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the REAP grant percentage?",
      answer: "The **Rural Energy for America Program (REAP)** can cover up to **50%** of total eligible project costs for renewable energy systems or energy efficiency improvements."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need to be a farmer to get a USDA rural grant?",
      answer: "No. The **Rural Business Development Grant (RBDG)** is open to small businesses in eligible rural areas, regardless of industry. You could be a rural tech company or bakery."

    {
      question: "How much does a grant writer cost?",
      answer: "Hourly rates range from **$80 to $200+** for professionals. Some work on a flat fee ($1,500 - $5,000 per application). **Never** hire a writer who works on 'commission only' (taking a cut of the grant) - it is unethical and often illegal."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I use AI to write my grant proposal?",
      answer: "Use AI for **ideation and outlining**, but not for the final draft. Reviewers are increasingly spotting 'AI-generic' language. Your unique story and specific data must come from you."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the most common reason for rejection?",
      answer: "**Failure to follow instructions.** Formatting errors (wrong font size, exceeding page limits) or missing mandatory attachments cause up to 20% of rejections before they are even read."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does it take to write a federal grant?",
      answer: "Budget **80 to 120 hours** for a major federal proposal (like SBIR or NIH). State grants might take 20-40 hours. Do not start one week before the deadline."
