  <div class="bg-green-50 border-l-4 border-green-500 p-6 rounded-r-lg mb-8">
    <p class="mb-4 text-green-800">Consider the example of 'Tactical Logistics,' a Calgary-based courier service founded by a former logistics officer. By utilizing the <strong>VAC Education and Training Benefit</strong> to obtain a supply chain management certification ($20k value), the founder minimized personal debt.</p>
    <p class="text-green-800">They then secured a $45,000 loan from <strong>Futurpreneur</strong> to lease their first two vehicles. Within two years, they scaled to a fleet of 10, utilizing the <strong>Prince's Trust</strong> mentorship program to navigate HR challenges. This "stacking" approach—education grant first, loan second, mentorship third—is a repeatable model for veteran success.</p>
