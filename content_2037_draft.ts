            Women - owned businesses are the fastest - growing segment of the economy, yet they receive less than 3 % of venture capital.
                In 2026, the funding landscape is shifting.A record number of < strong > private foundations, corporate sponsors, and federal agencies </strong> have committed over

        We recommend setting a recurring calendar reminder to apply to these.
