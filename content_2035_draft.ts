        < p class="text-blue-800 text-lg leading-relaxed" >
            The < strong > Community Development Block Grant(CDBG) </strong> is one of the oldest and most flexible federal programs. 
          In 2026, HUD has allocated over < strong > $3.3 billion </strong> to states and cities. For non-profits and community developers,
this isn't just funding; it's the bedrock of urban revitalization.But accessing it requires understanding the "Subrecipient" game.

    < h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6" >🏛️ How CDBG Actually Works </h2>
        < p class="text-gray-700 text-lg mb-6" >
            HUD does not write checks to individuals.They cut massive checks to "Entitlement Communities"(cities over 50k population) and State governments. 
        These local governments then regrant the money to organizations like yours.
